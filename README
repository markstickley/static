static v0.1

Description
-----------

static is an open source online document management system. That's a fancy way of saying "you upload and download files to and from it".

It's RESTful! It outputs in HTML, JSON and XML! It supports users, groups and permissions!

It also has modular support for file-type previews so feel free to add support where you think it's lacking.

Future work
-----------

OAuth support.
